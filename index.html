							<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">Children without dreams, children that lived through war, 
							and are now facing a cruel present and a doubtful future. 
							Mohammed protests: 
							“The Europeans see us only as refugees”.
							What kind of chances does a refugee has in a Europe 
							that constantly restrains his dreams? 
							-	“What do you hope for the future Mohammed?” 
							-	“Back in my country we had everything, at home we mattered.”
							The home country of a carefree childhood, the home country of family, of love, of acceptance, 
							of understanding, the home country of our heart. The home country of peace is the dream 
							and the aspiration for the future. Somehow the past, the present and the future create a perfect cyrcle. 
							The longing for home and the constant desire to return to Ithaca.
							Can Europe inspire, can Europe become a new homeland? 
							Our children, the children of solidarity join their voices 
							to be heard: “We do not want your pity, we want a chance, a chance to life!” 
							The children that contributed with their paintings to this exhibition are hosted 
							or supported within the framework of projects implemented by SolidarityNow:
